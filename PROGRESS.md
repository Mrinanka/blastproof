# Progress

## Current focus
Next: step 3 (demo company database and eval scenarios). Read backend plan §8 step 3, §5 (the
`blastproof` schema and `applied_actions`), §14 (incident replays) and §15 (`company-db`) first.

Stage 0 (setup) complete: plan audit, REQUIREMENTS.md and outside setup, decisions D-001 to D-062.
Step 1 (repo and skeleton) done and committed 2026-10-24, decisions D-063 to D-071.
Step 2 (CI) done 2026-10-24, decisions D-072 to D-075.

### Step 2, done 2026-10-24
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: one `backend` job on every pull request and on pushes to `develop` and
  `main`. It runs `uv sync --locked`, `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`,
  `docker compose up -d --wait` (D-072) and `pytest` (unit + integration). There are no secrets,
  the token is read-only, actions are SHA-pinned and the runner is `ubuntu-24.04` (D-075).
  `APP_ENV=test`, `NEON_CLIENT=fake`.
- uv pinned once with `required-version = "==0.13.5"` in `backend/pyproject.toml` (D-073).
- `.github/dependabot.yml`: weekly grouped PRs for uv, GitHub Actions and the Compose image
  digest, into `develop` (D-074).
- `backend/tests/test_ci_workflow.py`: 13 unit tests guarding the workflow and Dependabot config
  (64 tests in total).
- Done-when checked: PR #1 (`ci/step-2` → `develop`) shows a green `backend` check (commit
  `595f1cb`, 35 s). The first Linux run cleared two step 1 risks: publishing on `[::1]` works on the
  runner, and the `no_network` guard passes on Linux.
- Requirements ticked: DW-B02, ARCH-21. Left open: SEC-21 (alerts not confirmed on yet), OPS-01
  (seed, Alembic and evals are added to CI by steps 3, 4 and the Evals stage), TEST-01 and TEST-04
  (ongoing; CI holds no secrets and sets `NEON_CLIENT=fake`, which nothing reads yet).

### Step 1, done 2026-10-24
- Backend skeleton in `backend/`: `pyproject.toml` with the whole MVP stack pinned (D-065),
  `uv.lock`, Python 3.13; `config.py`, structlog JSON logging, pure-ASGI request-ID middleware
  (D-066), `GET /health`; Ruff with the `demo_company` import ban (TID251, also matches
  submodules); pytest (51 tests, 6 of them `integration`).
- `docker-compose.yml` with `blastproof-db` (`pgvector/pgvector:pg18`, digest-pinned, loopback
  only) and `docker/blastproof-init/01-roles.sql` creating `blastproof_owner` and
  `blastproof_app` (D-067, D-070).
- Done-when checked by hand: `docker compose up -d`, `uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`,
  `/health` returned `{"status":"ok"}` with an `X-Request-ID` header and JSON logs.
- Fixes after the verify review (D-068 to D-071): a crash now returns a 500 with
  `X-Request-ID`; the test network guard also covers asyncio numeric-IP connections and
  psycopg; the database port listens on loopback only; the image is digest-pinned; the no-temp-
  tables rule is deliberate and tested; `LOG_LEVEL` is validated; importing `app.main` no longer
  reads `.env`; `--log-config log_config.json` makes every dev log line JSON; integration tests
  fail fast with a clear message when Postgres is down.
- Requirements ticked: BE-01, BE-125, BE-126, TEST-07, OBS-04, DW-B01. Done for step 1 but left
  open because later steps finish them: BE-02 and BE-03 (`company-db`, step 3), ARCH-21 (rule
  configured and tested; "in CI" is step 2), OBS-02 and CONV-09 (`action_id` and stage timings,
  steps 8-16), CONV-16 (`package-lock.json`, F1), SEC-21 (Dependabot, step 2).

### Outside setup (Prompt 0D), done 2026-10-24
Checked without printing secrets:
- GitHub repo `Mrinanka/blastproof` reachable; Vercel GitHub App limited to that repo.
- Gemini API key (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`) connected OK (D-056).
- Neon: three projects; the dev project's project-scoped key, project ID and branch ID checked
  (Postgres 18, `aws-us-east-2`, default branch `production`; D-057, D-058).
- LangSmith key connected OK; project `blastproof-dev` created through the API.
- Embeddings: fastembed `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (D-059).
- Python 3.13 (`C:\Python313`, D-060), uv 0.13.5, Docker Desktop 29.9.2 with Compose v5.6.1,
  `psql` 18.6 through the `postgres:18` image, VS Code with the Python and Ruff extensions.
- Node 24.22.1 and npm 11.19.1 (D-061, D-062), Claude Code 2.1.310, React Developer Tools.

Moved: Playwright browsers install from `frontend/` once `@playwright/test` is added (frontend plan
section 2), so they match its pinned version.

Needed later (skipped now): Fly.io account and `flyctl` (deploy, Stage 4); Vercel AI Gateway key and
payment card (right after the MVP, for the Jev judge); the `blastproof-company` Neon API key,
created at deploy time straight into Fly.io secrets (D-058).

## Known issues
- Accepted dev limitation (D-002): on the dev machine, the agent could reach the dev `.env` by a
  route the hook and `permissions.deny` miss. It only unlocks the dev company project. Full
  isolation is verified on the deployed demo.
- Open until spikes run: the latency target for previewed writes and whether asyncpg prepared
  statements work through Neon's pooled endpoint (Neon spike; the plan assumes the direct
  endpoint), the hook timeout behaviour (hook spike), and the Claude Code MCP tool timeout vs the
  50 s long poll (MCP spike).
- Landing page CSP allows `'unsafe-inline'` scripts (D-028); verify the real headers in F1.
- Confirm `blastproof-company` and `blastproof-app` are on Postgres 18 in `aws-us-east-2` like the
  dev project (D-057); a project's version cannot change later.
- Gemini tier (free or paid with a spend cap) not yet confirmed; the free tier's rate limits can
  skew eval runs.
- Step 4 must check whether `CREATE EXTENSION vector` works as `blastproof_owner` (not a
  superuser). If not, the init script creates the extension instead.
- The MCP SDK is v2 and the plan describes v1 (D-063); the MCP spike must use the v2 API.
- Without `--log-config log_config.json`, uvicorn's reloader prints three plain-text lines
  before the app loads (the plan's Done-when command still works; CLAUDE.md uses the flag).
- `mcp` v2 pulls in `httpx2` alongside the plan's `httpx`; harmless. The test client logs each
  request through `httpx2` at INFO.
- The test network guard (`no_network`) covers Python sockets, asyncio and psycopg. A C
  extension that opens its own sockets would not be caught; none runs at startup today. Re-check
  when startup gains work (fastembed in step 11, Neon in step 10).
- The Postgres port is published on `127.0.0.1` and `[::1]`. Publishing only IPv4 made every
  `localhost` connection on Windows wait about 2 s for the IPv6 attempt to fail.
- Partial requirements from step 1, finished by later steps: BE-02 and BE-03 (`company-db`,
  step 3), OBS-02 and CONV-09 (`action_id` binding and stage timings, steps 8-16), CONV-16
  (`package-lock.json`, F1).
- SEC-21 needs the owner to turn on Dependabot alerts and security updates (Settings → Advanced
  Security). Tick it once that is confirmed.
- PR #1 merged into `develop` on 2026-10-24, so Dependabot now reads `dependabot.yml`. Its config
  is not yet checked: look for errors under Insights → Dependency graph → Dependabot.
- CI is partial (OPS-01): add `company-db` to Compose and `seed.py --target local` (step 3),
  `alembic upgrade head` (step 4), and incident replays plus rule-only evals (Evals stage). Update
  `REQUIRED_RUN_ORDER` in `tests/test_ci_workflow.py` when steps are added.
- CI cannot use `ubuntu-latest`. When 24.04 nears end of life, move the pin and its test together.
  Docker Compose on the runner is 2.38 while dev runs v5; keep `docker-compose.yml` to features
  both support.
- CI's Python is the latest 3.13 patch, which may differ from the dev machine's patch.
- `cancel-in-progress` means that when two pushes land on `develop` quickly, the older commit's run
  is cancelled and that commit gets no check.
- Branch protection (making `backend` a required check on `develop`) is not set; owner's choice.
- uv upgrades now start in `backend/pyproject.toml` (`required-version`); uv refuses to run at any
  other version.
- If anyone runs Compose on Linux without IPv6, check that publishing on `[::1]` still works (it
  does on GitHub's `ubuntu-24.04` runner).
- 404 and 422 responses still use FastAPI's default `{"detail": ...}` body, not CLAUDE.md's
  `{"error": {...}}` envelope. Only the crash 500 uses the envelope (D-068). Fixed in step 19.
- The crash path logs the full exception text. Nothing handles sensitive data yet, but once
  database code exists, a Postgres error can contain raw values (`invalid input syntax ...:
  "<value>"`). The masking work must cover exception text in logs too.
- `log_config.json` sets the reloader process's level to INFO, so that process ignores
  `LOG_LEVEL` (the app process respects it). Dev only.
- Test helpers (`NetworkGuard`, database URLs) live in `tests/conftest.py` and are imported
  from it (hence `tests/__init__.py`). Move them to `tests/support.py` when the suite grows.
- `FastAPI(version="0.1.0")` duplicates the version in `pyproject.toml`.
