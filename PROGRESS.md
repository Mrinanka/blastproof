# Progress

## Current focus
Stage 0: setup. Plan audit decisions applied (D-001 to D-016), then a follow-up review of the
applied plan fixed (D-017 to D-029), all on 2026-10-24. Prompt 0B drafted `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`.
Prompt 0C done: spot-check fixes applied, and all 26 "Implied, needs confirmation" items settled
(23 from 0B plus 3 found in the spot-check; D-030 to D-055). Prompt 0D done: outside setup
finished and checked, decisions D-056 to D-062 (Gemini, Postgres 18, prod Neon key at deploy,
fastembed, Python 3.13, npm, Node 24). Prompt 0E done: repo files committed and pushed, Stage 0
complete. Next: step 1 (repo and skeleton).

### Outside setup (Prompt 0D), done 2026-10-24
Checked without printing secrets:
- GitHub repo `Mrinanka/blastproof` reachable; Vercel GitHub App limited to that repo.
- Gemini API key (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`) connected OK (D-056).
- Neon: three projects; the dev project's project-scoped key, project ID and branch ID checked
  (Postgres 18, `aws-us-east-2`, default branch `production`; D-057, D-058).
- LangSmith key connected OK; project `blastproof-dev` created through the API.
- Embeddings: fastembed `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (D-059).
- Python 3.13 (`C:\Python313`, D-060), uv 0.13.5, Docker Desktop 29.9.2 with Compose v5.6.1,
  `psql` 18.6 through the `postgres:18` image, VS Code with the Python and Ruff extensions.
- Node 24.22.1 and npm 11.19.1 (D-061, D-062), Claude Code 2.1.310, React Developer Tools.

Moved: Playwright browsers install from `frontend/` once `@playwright/test` is added (frontend plan
section 2), so they match its pinned version.

Needed later (skipped now): Fly.io account and `flyctl` (deploy, Stage 4); Vercel AI Gateway key and
payment card (right after the MVP, for the Jev judge); the `blastproof-company` Neon API key,
created at deploy time straight into Fly.io secrets (D-058).

## Known issues
- Accepted dev limitation (D-002): on the dev machine, the agent could reach the dev `.env` by a
  route the hook and `permissions.deny` miss. It only unlocks the dev company project. Full
  isolation is verified on the deployed demo.
- Open until spikes run: the latency target for previewed writes and whether asyncpg prepared
  statements work through Neon's pooled endpoint (Neon spike; the plan assumes the direct
  endpoint), the hook timeout behaviour (hook spike), and the Claude Code MCP tool timeout vs the
  50 s long poll (MCP spike).
- Landing page CSP allows `'unsafe-inline'` scripts (D-028); verify the real headers in F1.
- Confirm `blastproof-company` and `blastproof-app` are on Postgres 18 in `aws-us-east-2` like the
  dev project (D-057); a project's version cannot change later.
- Gemini tier (free or paid with a spend cap) not yet confirmed; the free tier's rate limits can
  skew eval runs.
